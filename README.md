## Welcome to Brondell01's GitHub Page

It's at this Point that I'll attempt to provide access to the Code Review of my initial Inventory Applicaton artifcat. The purpose of the code review was to indentify issues that needed correction and illustrate planned changes that would meet the requirements of the Capstone course final project. 

###### Lis of items to complete.
- [x]  create new functionality for reporting within application
- [x]  draw conclusions on how new ehnacments meet basic requirements for employement
- [x]  begin to develop IO page/explore functionality
- [ ]  clean up code for readability
- [ ]  draft format and wording for showcase
- [ ]  finalize ePortfolio

### Code Review
For this artifact I've taken the time to run through a formal code review process of the Inventory Applicaton. As stated, this application provides a great opportunity to showcase various skills. The code review here will set a functional baseline for the artifact as it stands now. It's important to remember that this artifact was created for a previous course and the planned enhancements I discuss in the review will not only improve the existing code base but expand it's functionality to match the project requirements. 

As you will see in the following videos, a review of the code provides a great opportunity to identify potential improvments and gaps in logic, as well as refocusing attention on some of the smaller details assocaited with creating an application. As this Inventory Application currently stands, you will see a great deal of reduntant code and a lack of clairty in design. The code review video will walk you through my thought process as I identify needed improvements and plan my next steps.

### Reporting page  gif

for use later in development of page, can use this screen shot to illustrate reports page and sorting functions. 

![ReportsSorting](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61640483/144323938-4564e83c-3bd9-4ada-b601-683a6aea66fd.gif)




## Algorithms and Data Structures

Section will be used to highlight the code and explain the functionality of the sorting added to the report feature.  For example; let's include and describe the bubble sort here....
```java
public void bubbleSort(List<History> list, String button){
            int n = list.size();
             for (int i = 0; i < n-1; i++){
                 for (int j = 0; j < n-i-1; j++){

                     if(button == "COUNT"){
                         if(list.get(j).getCountChange() > list.get(j + 1).getCountChange()) {
                             if(list.get(j).getId() < list.get(j + 1).getId()) {
                                 //swaping J and J+1
                                 History temp = list.get(j);
                                 list.set(j, list.get(j + 1));
                                 list.set(j + 1, temp);
                             }
                         }
                     }

```


## Database

The Room Persistence Librabry has been used within the Inventory Application to allow the use of basic SQL database functions to store and manage historical data. The use of this library requires three different classes to be created and maintained. The "Entity" acts as the model and basic structure of the database table, the "Database" creates the table and links it's creation to the "Entity, and the "DAO" allows us to create SQL like commands to be executed within Java code that control interaction with data in the database. 

### Entity
```java

@Entity(tableName = "History")
@TypeConverters(DateConverter.class)
public class History implements Serializable {


      @NonNull
      @PrimaryKey
      @ColumnInfo(name="id", defaultValue = "0")
      private Integer id;

        @NonNull
        @ColumnInfo(name="itemName")
        private String itemName;

        @NonNull
        @ColumnInfo(name="countChange")
        private int countChange;

        @ColumnInfo(name="changeType")
        private String changeType;

        @ColumnInfo(name="changeDate")
        private Date changeDate;
```

### Database
```java

@Database(entities ={History.class},version = 1)
public abstract class HistoryDatabase extends RoomDatabase {
    private static final String DATABASE_NAME = "history3.db";

    private static HistoryDatabase historyDatabase;

    public abstract HistoryDao historyDao();
}
```

### DAO
```java
@Dao
public interface HistoryDao {

    @Query("SELECT * FROM History")
    public List<History> getHistory();

    @Query("SELECT MAX(id) FROM History")
    public int getMaxId();

    @Query("SELECT * FROM History WHERE itemName= :itemName")
    public List<History> getHistoryByItemName(String itemName);

    @Insert(onConflict = OnConflictStrategy.ABORT)
    public void insertHistory(History history);

    @Update
    public void updateHistory(History history);

    @Delete
    public void deleteHistory(History history);

}

```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/Brondell01/Brondell01.github.io/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
